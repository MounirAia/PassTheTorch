# PassTheTorch
A small platformer to speedrun. It took me approximately 5 months to devellop this game (with school on top for at least 3 months of developpement).

To play the game you can go on [itch.io](https://nir9420.itch.io/passthetorch)

## Technology
I programmed this game with **lua** and I used the framework **LOVE 2D**.
The **level** were created with **Tiled editor**.
The **sprites** were drawn with **pyxel edit**.

## My contribution
I coded all the game and drawn everything. 
I bought the music on humble bundle.

## What I learned
- Game loop theory.
- How to implement a basic collision detection.
- Working with multiple levels.
- Managing differents scenes (menu/game/game over).
- Animation system.
- Implementing an OOP (not as develloped as JAVA or any other oriented OOP languages) approach to implement the differents feature on the game. 
- Working with list of object (sprites).
- Time management (decision making, clearly stating the scope of your project). 
- How to keep motivation with project that takes time to create.
